SpatialMapper
=============

My BA Thesis software for quad warp projection mapping

INSTRUCTIONS
1. Plug in projector, under system settings set it to EXTEND DESKTOP mode
2. Run Spatial Mapper.exe
3. Go to View->Render to New Window, projector screen should go all black
4. Right click on Layers -> New Layer
5. Now you will see a checker box at the middle
6. Take mouse to the other screen and click on 4 corners of the surface you want to map starting from 
Bottom Left-> Top Left -> Bottom Right -> Top Left (IT IS IMPORTANT TO KEEP THE ORDER)
Later you can adjust them with the sliders in Transform Tab
7. You can add as many surfaces as you want, you can remap them by selecting the right layer in the listbox
8. Right click on Media->Add new Media (Select Movie File/Image File)
9. Once imported click on Layers Media and click Apply Texture
10. You are done. You can add multiple surfaces, and apply to them multiple Media Files.
11. Control the videos in Media Controller Tab
12. If you will play with opacity you might see the checker pattern appear to fix this go to View->Hide Layer Background
13. If you meet lack of performance you may try to View->Hide Preview

14. HAVE FUN!
